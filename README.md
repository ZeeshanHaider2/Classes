Task 1 : Library

Build a Library
Congratulations, you’ve become head librarian at your local Books-‘N-Stuff, which is in dire need of your help. They’re still using index cards to organize their content! Yikes.

But no matter, you know some JavaScript, so let’s get to work modernizing your new digs.

Books-‘N-Stuff carries three different types of media: books, CDs, and movies. In this project you will create a parent class named Media with three subclasses: Book, Movie, and CD. These three subclasses have the following properties and methods:

Book
Properties: author (string), title (string), pages (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty).
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()
Movie
Properties: director (string), title (string), runTime (number), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty)
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()
CD
Properties: artist (string), title (string), isCheckedOut (boolean, initially false), and ratings (array, initially empty), songs (array of strings)
Getters: all properties have a getter
Methods: .getAverageRating(), .toggleCheckOutStatus(), and .addRating()
If you’re looking for a challenge, try to create the four classes without using the steps below.


Task 2

School Catalogue
Let’s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.

We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

School
Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
Getters: all properties have getters
Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)
Primary
Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
Properties: pickupPolicy (string)
Middle
Does not include any additional properties or methods
High
Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)
If you’re looking for a challenge, create the constructor() and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
